# Dimensionality reduction
 Dimensionality reduction is such an technique in which we reduce the dimension of the data in such a way that the dimesion's of the data are reduced without losing much of our data. That is, we try to keep maximum of our data with reducing the dimensions which do not carry much weighteage in our data.  

# Application of Dimensionality reduction techniques
 The successful application of Dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Compnent Analysis (PCA) and T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) on real world MNIST data for digit recognizer. 
I have succeccfuly applied PCA and T-SNE on real world data for data visualization i.e reducing dimensions from 784 dimension to 2 dimension (2-D). Along with this also applied dimensionality reduction to prepare the data for ML & DL algorithms.
