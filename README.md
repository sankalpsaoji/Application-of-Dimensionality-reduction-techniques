# Dimensionality reduction
 Dimensionality reduction is a technique in which we reduce the dimensions of the data in such a way that the dimesion's of the data are reduced without losing much of our data. That is, we try to keep maximum of our data with reducing the dimensions which do not carry much weighteage in our data (Dimensions which have low varience). 

# Application of Dimensionality reduction techniques
 The successful application of Dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Compnent Analysis (PCA) and T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) on real world MNIST data for digit recognizer. 
I have succeccfuly applied PCA and T-SNE on real world data for data visualization i.e reducing dimensions from 784 dimension to 2 dimension (2-D). Along with this also applied dimensionality reduction to prepare the data for ML & DL algorithms.

t-SNE is one of the most extensively used dimensionality reduction techniques in data science, as t-SNE is a randomized technique. Hence, I have used t-SNE iteratively with changing number of diffrent parameters such as (perplexity and number of itertaions) for most efficient results.
