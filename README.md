# Application of Dimensionality reduction techniques
 Application of Dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal compnent analysis known as PCA and T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) on real world MNIST data for digit recognizer. 
Succeccfuly applied PCA and T-SNE on real world data for data visualization i.e from 784 dimension to 2 dimension (2-D) and a;slso dimensionality reduction to prepare data for ML & DL algorithms. 

# Dimensionality reduction
 Dimensionality reduction is such an technique in which we reduce the dimension of the data in such a way that the dimesion are reduces without losing much of our data. That is we try to keep maximum of our data with reducing the dimensions which do not carry much weighteage in our data.
